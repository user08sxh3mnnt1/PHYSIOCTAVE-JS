# PHYSIOCTAVE-JS

PHYSIOCTAVE-JS is an interactive JavaScript tool designed by bluepenguins for exploring the connection between physics and music. This web application features a dynamic canvas where users can create a bouncing ball that generates musical notes upon collisions with the canvas boundaries.

## Features

- **Interactive Canvas:** The canvas serves as a dynamic environment where a bouncing ball interacts with the boundaries, creating a visually engaging experience.

- **Musical Notes:** Each collision of the ball with the canvas edges triggers the generation of a musical note. The notes follow a predefined musical scale.

- **Scale Input:** Users can input a custom musical scale, specifying notes separated by commas (e.g., C4, D4, E4). The ball's behavior adapts to the provided scale.

- **Real-time Feedback:** The canvas provides real-time feedback on the ball's position, allowing users to witness the correlation between physics and music.

## How it Works

1. **Bouncing Ball:** The ball bounces around the canvas, and its collisions with the edges trigger the generation of musical notes.

2. **Musical Scale:** Users can customize the musical scale by entering a sequence of notes in the input field. The ball generates notes based on this scale.

3. **Real-time Interaction:** Users can interact with the ball by clicking and dragging, influencing its trajectory and velocity.

4. **Damping Effect:** The ball's velocity is damped over time, simulating a more realistic physics behavior.

5. **Visual and Auditory Feedback:** The canvas visually displays the ball's movements, while the generated musical notes provide an auditory representation of the physics-music connection.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.

2. Observe the ball's interaction with the canvas edges, triggering musical notes.

3. Optionally, input a custom musical scale in the provided text field and click "Apply Sequence" to see how the ball's behavior changes.

4. Click and drag the ball to interact with its movement in real-time.

5. Enjoy the visual and auditory feedback as you explore the physics-music relationship.
